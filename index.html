            <h2>I'm Bek</h2>
            <p class="profile-text">Very passionate about web development. Despite facing financial challenges that prevented me from completing my university education, majoring in Computer Science and Software Engineering I've embarked on a journey to become a self-taught web developer. Through dedication, perseverance, and a love for coding, I've honed my skills and gained valuable experience in creating responsive websites and web applications.
                <br> <br>
                On this website, I aim to showcase my portfolio, share insights into my coding journey, and provide resources and tips for aspiring web developers who may be facing similar obstacles. I believe that talent and determination can overcome any barrier, and I'm committed to proving that a lack of formal education doesn't define one's potential in the tech industry.
                <br> <br>
                Join me as I continue to learn, grow, and make an impact in the world of web development. Together, let's inspire others to pursue their dreams, regardless of the challenges they may face.
                <br> <br>
                Thank you for visiting</p>
